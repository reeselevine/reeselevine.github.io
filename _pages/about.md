I am a sixth (and final) year PhD candidate and an [NDSEG Fellow](https://ndseg.org/) at UC Santa Cruz, where I work with [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/) and am generally affiliated with the [LSD Lab](https://lsd.ucsc.edu/) (I also co-organize the [LSD seminar](https://lsd.ucsc.edu/lsd-seminar/)). My research interests are in parallel computing. My work has focused on GPU programming models, including designing and evaluating techniques to test the conformance of compilers and hardware to memory model specifications [[1](assets/pdf/mc_mutants.pdf), [2](assets/pdf/gpuharbor.pdf)], and testing and improving the safety properties of GPU programming languages in the face of data races [[3](assets/pdf/saferace.pdf)].

I am currently collaborating on projects related to GPU security and compiler correctness. I am also actively contributing to [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) in order to bring GPU-accelerated inference to the browser using WebGPU, opening up research opportunities in portable performance, efficient LLM quantization, and improving GPU programming models.

I am on the job market this year. Please reach out if you know of or are hiring for tenure-track/postdoc/research opportunities related to parallel computing, GPU programming models, and machine learning systems.
