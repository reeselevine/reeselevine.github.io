I am a fifth year PhD candidate and an [NDSEG Fellow](https://ndseg.org/) at UC Santa Cruz, where I work with [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/) and am generally affiliated with the [LSD Lab](https://lsd.ucsc.edu/).

My research interests are in parallel and concurrent programming, specifically how multi-core and distributed systems are implemented. My current work focuses on GPU memory models, designing and evaluating techniques to test the conformance of compilers and hardware to specifications. I am also working on ways to exploit weak memory behaviors to increase applications' performance, and to test and improve the safety properties of GPU programming models in the face of data races or other undefined behavior.
